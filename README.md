# Heart_Disease_ML_Project
A binary classification supervised machine learning problem to classify whether a patient has a heart disease or not. In this project, I compare the performance between using logistic regression, random forests and decision trees. The dataset used is the open-sourced Heart Disease UCI dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
