# Heart_Disease_ML_Project
This project uses a Logistic Regression model using the scikit-learn library on Python to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. This problem is a binary classification problem which is most suited to solve using logistic regression. The dataset used is the open-sourced Heart Disease UCI dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
